        It was midnight, when Jane woke up on hearing men whispering outside their cottage. Their family was on a trip to Tadoba Andhari National Park. Peeping out of the window, she saw two men walking towards the forest carrying a bag. Jane caught a glance of something yellowish which aroused some questions in her mind. One of the men was staying in the next cottage, but she could not see the other one in the dark.

        The next morning, when she told her father about the incident, he too was surprised. He informed the manager of the resort, who assured them that he would look into the matter. Leaving their thoughts behind, they set out for their first jungle safari of the trip. It was a wonderful surrounding of light and shade, green and brown. The picturesque surrounding, the sight of the deers, peacocks and unique birds- everything was special, but the end of the safari was an unforgettable one. While passing by the lake on their way back, they caught the glimpses of tigress Lara having a mick fight in the lake, posing for pictures. They were even playing hide-and-seek behind the bushes, which created magical frames of the big cat in the wild.

        However, back at the cottage, she could not stop thinking about the incident of the previous night. At noon, when she was passing by the caretaker's hut, she noticed the same bag lying in front of it. Finding no one around, she went to look and gasped at what she saw. It had a leopard's skin inside. She rushed to her father with the bag of evidence, andthey informed the manager of the resort immediately. The mystery was soon solved. The caretaker of the resort, accompanied by a man liivng in one of the cottages, was involved in hunting. Even there were many anti-socials and smugglers behind it. The two men had no other option but to confess in front of the forest officials, and they had to be arrested.

        Everyone praised Jane as well as her father for their excellent bravery and presence of mind. However, the most important lesson which everyone learnt was the necessity of preserving wildlife in the present world.
