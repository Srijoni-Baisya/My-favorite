        I love reading storybooks. Since my childhood, my parents have always encouraged me to read more and more storybooks. Storybooks help us to enhance our knowledge, widen our thoughts and make us better learners in life. Whenever I feel bored, storybooks keep me occupied, thus helping me to spend my free time. I enjoy reading detective, adventurous and motivational stories. I find the storybooks written by Enid Blyton, JK Rowling, Roald Dahl, Ruskin Bond and Sudha Murty to be highly interesting. Whenever I read a storybook, I can visualize the charcters in my mind and I seem to be a magical world of fictional as well as real characters. I often borrow books from my friends and our school library, which gives me flexibility to read the vooks according to my time and understand its inner meaning. The books convey various messages, like 'never give up hope', 'good over evil', 'set and achieve your goals, and many more. I wish to read more and more storybooks and become a true bookworm in future.
